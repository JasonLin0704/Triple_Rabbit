## Rules
1. Combine and Upgrade
    - Put the same items together. If the number >= 3, then the last item put on will upgrade and others will disappear.
    - Allow chain upgradations, which means after one item upgrading, there might another upgradation happening at the same spot.
    - Blue arrows demonstrate the valid upgrading directions; red texts indicate the points can get after upgradation. 

2. Repel rabbits
    - There are two rabbits: normal rabbits and G8rabbits.
    - Normal rabbits will move one step around randomly. If they get surrounded by buildings, carrots or coins, they'll escape and leave carrots.
    - G8rabbits will go anywhere randomly. If there's no space to move on the board, they'll escape as well, leaving more carrots.
    
3. Special items
    - Crystal: it can combine with many items, considering the priority: CARROTS > CARROT > HOUSE > TREE > BUSH > GRASS.
    - Hammer: it can destroy anything, also drive out a rabbit.
